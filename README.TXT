everyidea is a website originally created by Isabelle Rugg to promote
education and crowdsourced idea generation related to some of the
problems the world faces today.  It is a collaborative effort with
several contributors.

Technologies used:

* Google Domains - a domain registrar that redirects everyidea.net to the appropriate place.
* Google AppEngine - a cloud hosting site that runs the code
* Google Datastore - the database used to store information like user profiles
