everyidea is a website originally created by Isabelle Rugg to promote
education and crowdsourced idea generation related to some of the
problems the world faces today.  It is a collaborative effort with
several contributors.

* Java - a programming language that is necessary for eclipse even though we aren't going to use it at all
* Git - pulling new changes from origin and pushing improvements added by you
* GitHub - a  website that stores our changes
* GitHub Desktop - an application on the computer that communicates with the website in the cloud and lets us push and pull the improvements
* HTML - a simple programming language that browsers can understand to display web pages
