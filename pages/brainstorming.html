								<p>On this page, there will be ideas that are created by several people, on how to conserve water, how to desalinate it (take the salt out of salt water), and how to filter it. If you want to contribute to this page, send an email to the website creators with all of your ideas (email at bottom of page). Remember, NO IDEA IS A BAD IDEA. You will soon be able to throw in pros and cons of other ideas to help find a solution.</p>
