								<p>On this page, there will be ideas that are created by several people, on how to conserve water, how to desalinate it (take the salt out of salt water), and how to filter it. If you want to contribute to this page, send an email to the website creators with all of your ideas (email at bottom of page). Remember, NO IDEA IS A BAD IDEA. You will soon be able to throw in pros and cons of other ideas to help find a solution.</p>

                            		<li>More cricket farms/ eat more crickets - crickets do not need much water to grow, unlike other animals like cows. If we ate more crickets, then we would save more water. (I know it sounds gross, but it could help)</li>
                            		<li>Create crops with a high tolerance to salinity - the main use of fresh water is agriculture, if we could  use salt water as a substitution then we could save much more water
                            			<ul>
                            				<li>In the Netherlands they have created a potato that can do just that. Although it is amazing, none of our main crops have that ability just yet.</li>

                            		</li>
                            		<li>Desalination (there are three types listed below)

                            				<li>Reverse Osmosis

                            						<li>Ocean water is used as potable, drinkable, water</li>
                            						<li>But, each plant costs around $1 billion.</li>
                            					</ul>

                            				<li>Boiling Water
                            					<ul>
                            						<li>Ocean water is boiled and then used as potable water</li>
                            					</ul>

                            						<li>Saltier water is used to to draw out salt from the ocean and is done in a redudant cycle
                            						<li>Process is very energy efficient; done/goes with osmosis.</li>
