								<p>There are many experiments that can further your understanding of desalination, the water cycle, and filtration. There are more to come, but for now here is one:</p>

                            </p>
                            <ol style='text-align:left'>
                            	<li>Desalination Experiment-
                            		<br/>
                            		<ul>
                            			<li>Supplies:
                            				<ul>
                            					<li>a large bowl</li>
                            					<li>a smaller, heavy bowl</li>
                            					<li>plastic wrap</li>
                            					<li>a large rubber band</li>
                            					<li>a small, but slightly heavy rock</li>
                          				  		<li>salt water</li>
                          				  		<li>a flat surface outside where the sun can reach it</li>
                         				   	</ul>
                         				</li>
                            			<li>Instructions:
                            				<ol>
                            					<li>Take your large bowl and place it on your flat surface.</li>
                            					<li>Take your smaller bowl and place it inside the bowl, as close to the center as possible.</li>
                            					<li>Fill the larger bowl with the salt water and stop before the water level reaches the top of the smaller bowl./li>
                            					<li>Cover the top of the large bowl with plastic wrap and secure with the rubber band. Do not make it extremely taught, but
                            					do not leave too much slack either.<li>
                            					<li>Place the rock on the center of the plastic wrap. It should sink down slightly.</li>
                            					<li>Leave your contraption out in the sun until all of the water evaporates.</li>
                            					<li>When you finish your experiment, there should be water in the small bowl. This no longer contains salt. NOTE: To clean the large bowl, soak it in warm
                            					water until the salt dissolves. Then, rinse the bowl.</li>
                            				</ol>
                            			</li>
                            			<li>How this works:
                            			</br> When the water evaporates, is cannot escape due to the plastic wrap blocking the way. When it hits the top, it solidifies. Since the 
                            			rock is tilting the "roof" down, the water rolls down toward the rock. There, it drops down, into the smaller bowl waiting to collect the drop.
                            			It continues to do this until only the salt is left in the large bowl and the desalinated water is left in the small bowl.
                            			</li>
                            		</ul>
                            		
                            	</li>
                            </ol>
