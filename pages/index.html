								<h3>The Problem</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
The world population is gradually growing, and the demand for water is increasing along with it. Our lack of water will eventually
become the cause of war and devastation, so we need to find a solution, and fast. Not only scientists can help solve this problem,
everybody can, including kids.

This website is built to inform people of all ages (especially children) about the water problem and let them contribute to the discovery
of a solution.  There is a reading list and a news page, as well as pages with experiments and brainstorming. On top of that, you can
donate money to our website and other organizations on the fundraising page as well.  You can find these in the menu at the top of the
page. If you would like to make an account, you can sign up and get added to the email list.

In case you were wondering (it's alright if you weren't), I, am Isabelle, the website creator. I am a 12 year old girl that lives in
the Bay Area (California). I plan to eventually expand this website so it focuses on other world problems as well, like global warming.
