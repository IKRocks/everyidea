This website is built to inform people of all ages (especially children) about global problems and let them contribute to the discovery
of solutions. There is a reading list and a news page, as well as pages with experiments and brainstorming. On top of that, you can
donate money to our website and other organizations on the fundraising page as well.  You can find these in the menu at the top of the
page. If you would like to sign in with Google, you can sign up and get added to the email list. </br></br>NOTE: This website is not finished and most pages are not completed yet. We will be update the site in small portions, and soon it
will be finalized. Every page, especially the News page, will constantly be adjusted to stay up to date. Unfortunately you are not
able to set up an account yet, so please come back later and you will be able to do just that. Presently, you can sign in with Google to be added to the email list.
If you choose to do so, you will get updates as the website moves along. We are in the process of adding more admins, so when that is completed our site should update more frequently.
 Soon another section of this  website will be added, and it will focus on global warming. Thank you for visiting our website!

								<h3>Water Shortages</h3>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align:left">
The world's population is gradually growing, and the demand for water is increasing with it. For each person that passes every day, two more are born.
 If our numbers continue to grow this steadily,our inability to gain water will eventually become the cause of war and devastation. We need to find
 a solution, and fast. 
 </br></br>Not only scientists can help solve these global problems, everybody can, including kids.
