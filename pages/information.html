						<p>Information necessary to get a better understanding of global warming. You'll also find some cool
						 facts while reading this page.</p>
						<hr>	
						<ul>
							<li>
							[Matthews and Zimmerman, 1990] Fish, particularly in the Great Plains and Southwest region, are 
							very likely to face extinction unless they behaviorally adapt. However, evidence has shown that 
							behavioral adaptation is very unlikely. This will lead to a loss of a common food source for people,
						 	and will also severely mess up the local ecosystems. Fishermen & people who work with sea creatures 
							 would be unemployed which could put them in poverty extremely quickly.
						 	</li>
						 	<li>
						 	[WEF] 2.5 million people have been displaced by global warming already. 
						 	</li>
						 	<li>
						 	[NOAA] 39% of just the US lives in a coastal area, and that number is expected to increase by 8%
						 	 by 2020. All of these areas would have been flooded along with some others which pushes about
						 	  half of our population inland
						 	</li>
						 	<li>
						 	When sea levels and temperatures rise, countries lose access to some resources such as clean water
						 	, land, etc. and engage in conflicts to regain these resources.
						 	</li>
						 	<li>
						 	Already happened once in Darfur, where the lack of resources + political instability caused a 
						 	civil war to break out. 
						 	</li>
						 	<li>
						 	Many island countries are facing the threat of rising sea levels that cause internal & external
						 	 conflict (ie. the Maldives, Indonesia, etc)
						 	</li>
